                <p>You can always watch reviews online about the latest and greatest but if you ask me I believe that the ones that adapt to new situtions, such as no fees for any trades that Rodinhood or Webull pioneered,
                you got such a reliable and strong platform.</p>

                <p>The verification process is made as simple and easy as possible these days. It will take you 10-15 mins on average but this is to make sure no one else trades your money. This pocess also makes sure 
              you don't lose your own money. Trust when I say "now-a-days" you can be a complete noob and watch a tutorial of some expert opening another account and observe as you're filling out the same answers as he/she
              does and jump to a Level II or III trader, just to completely eviscerate your very own finances.</p>
                <p>Besides the very obvious things you should not do and do get ready to trade like a Pro.</p>

                <p>An option is a contract giving the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy, in the case of a call,  or sell, in the case of a put, the underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date.
                  A stock option contract typically represents 100 shares of the underlying stock, but options may be written on any sort of underlying asset from bonds to currencies or to commodities.
                </p>
                <p>Trading options, once you know how, can generate big gain. Many have become millionaires or 100x their portfolios over night on really risky options plays. On the other hand many people have also been margin 
                called, wiped out their entire portfolio on multiple accounts, owe in some sort of fashion til this day. You must be carful and must deplay a strategy.</p>

                <p>TheSTRAT is a form of charting method where one should analyze multiple timeframes. Plain and simple you have to be a Day Trader for this Strat ($25,000 minimum). Normal buying and selling of contracts are 
                  risky too just because of the manner they are written, they lose you money as time goes by, that is way you must understand and read well the greeks of the contract you get yourself into. Every week they 
                  expire and if they expire OTM and you don't have enough money in your account you will be margin called, meaning you will have to buy, 100x of shares per contract.</p>
                <p>As you can tell if you don't know what you are doing you will blow your account faster than believing you'll be rich. Honestly it's not all that bad though people already have figuered out a way how to 
                  stop time decay of a contract by buying a Put and a Call expiring on the same week, this strategy is called a straddle. There are far superior stratgies out there you would just have to find them out yourself.</p>

                <h5>Timing the market!</h5>
                <div class="market_img" style="height:500px; width: 600px; background-image: url(img/process_faith.jpg); margin: 5px auto 40px auto;"></div>
                <p>It is true what they say about timing the market because if you are at the edge of an ascending wedge or a descending wedge it can make a big difference when selling that option contract. If you are smart 
                  you'll buy contracts further out (i.e. months ahead.) which requires patience. In that time why not earn some premium as a possible strategy.</p>
                <p>All this requiers sacrificing money, money and money though but if you really want to learn you have to go through the process which everyone goes through. </p>
